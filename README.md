# Educational-Institution
The present project in Python can maintain, access, and process a list of students in an educational institution.
The application can perform the following functions:

View all students
Search for students
Add a new student
Delete a student
Print the list of students
Exit the application
For each student stored in the system, the following details are maintained:

Last name
First name
Mobile phone
Registration number
During the execution of the application, the following will occur:

View all students

All students will be displayed in columns.
The application will prompt the user to choose the field for the search:
Last name
First name
Mobile phone
Registration number
The user will input the desired value, and the corresponding results will be displayed.
Add a new student

During the addition of a new student, the application will check the validity of the entered data.
Last name and first name should not contain numbers.
The mobile phone should consist of ten digits and should not contain characters.
The registration number should be a number.
Last name and first name should not exceed a length of 15 characters.
Upon successful completion of the addition, the corresponding success message will be displayed.
Delete a student

For deleting a student, the application will first display all students and then ask for the user to input the student's A/A (serial number) to be deleted.
After checking if a student with that A/A exists, the application proceeds with the deletion.
Upon successful completion of the deletion, the corresponding success message will be displayed.
Print the list of students

The list of students, as presented in function 1, will be printed to a file named students.txt in the same folder as the program file.
Exit the application

The application terminates, displaying the corresponding exit message.
